# PersonalDiary
<h3>✅ Description</h3>
This is a simple web-based Personal Diary Management System developed during my first semester to practically demonstrate core SQL operations — INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT — using a real-world scenario.

The project includes:

User Authentication: A login/signup system that inserts new user records into a MySQL database and fetches them for login validation.

Diary Entries: Users can write multiple diary entries. Each entry can be added, edited, or deleted, demonstrating full CRUD operations.

My Diaries Section: Displays all diary entries for the logged-in user, showing dynamic data fetching.

Reminder System: A reminder feature allows users to set personalized reminders for diary writing, showcasing interaction with date/time fields in SQL.

The project is built using PHP and MySQL for backend logic and data storage, hosted on XAMPP. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a simple, functional user interface.
